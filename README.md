Good afternoon.

I have been an active validator in many projects for over 2 years. Maintained the operation of the node around the clock. I know many programming languages, which helps me a lot, here they are Typescript, Go, bash, python, Java, C#, C++, Perl.

ARCHWAY - active validator during testnet, GRAVITY - active mainnet validator, Ironfish - active validator, Subspace Network - active validator and ambassador, Aptos - active validator during testnet. Participated in and revived blockchains such as Subspace Network, ARCHWAY and Aptos. I was a validator and ambassador for Subspace Network and was actively involved in project management
